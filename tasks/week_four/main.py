# This is the file for your week four task.
# For today the only help is the check_solution function.
# If you finished part one I can give you part two (or you pull the repo by yourself).

# This function is used to check if your solution is correct.
# It will NOT return if your solution is incorrect. 
# Instead the python test can be used to check if your solution is correct.
# You have to call your solution in this function and save the result in the solution variable.
