# Task 1
# We need a little helper program to compare the power of our cars.
# We have three different types of cars in our garage:
#   SportCar with street license
#   SportCar without street license
#   Prototype car


# Our cars have different attributes:
#  hp: int
#  zero_to_hundred: float
#  weight: float
#  max_speed: float


# We want to compare the cars.
# Therefore we calculate the acceleration and calculate the time it takes to drive 1000 meters.
# The basic formula for the acceleration is:
# a = v / t

# The sport car with a street license has a weight of 1500kg and a max speed of 250km/h and 500hp and a zero to hundred time of 5 seconds.

# The sport car without a street license has a weight of 1000kg and a max speed of 300km/h and 700hp and a zero to hundred time of 3.6 seconds.

# The prototype car has a weight of 1000kg and a max speed of 330km/h and 1000hp and a zero to hundred time of 2.1 seconds.



# Create a class for the cars.
# Create a method which calculates the acceleration:
# Create a method which calculates the distance for a given time.
# Print the results in diagrams. (print what ever you want)
# We simplify the problem. We use discrete values for the acceleration and the distance.


# Task 2
# The second task is to create a perceptron.
# A perceptron has multiple inputs and one output.
